## Overview
In summary, this code automates the testing of a web page's alert functionality by triggering two fake alerts, interacting with the alerts by clicking OK buttons, and verifying the display and disappearance of the alert message using TestNG's assertion methods. The code assumes that the elements with specific "id" attributes exist on the web page and perform the expected actions when interacted with.
